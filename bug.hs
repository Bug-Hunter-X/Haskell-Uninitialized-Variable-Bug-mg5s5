This Haskell code attempts to use an uninitialized variable, leading to a runtime error.  The variable `result` is declared but never assigned a value before being used in the `print` statement.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = undefined  --Uninitialized variable
  print result
```
